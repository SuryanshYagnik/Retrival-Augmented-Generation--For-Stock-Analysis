However, sometimes they struggle with factual accuracy or keeping information up to date. Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) solves this by adding a \"research assistant\" step:\n\n1. **Retrieval**: When you give the LLM a prompt or question, RAG first searches through a database of texts 📜 - like having access to a giant virtual library! It retrieves relevant snippets of information that could be useful for composing its response.\n\n2. **Augmentation**: Those retrieved context passages are then incorporated into the prompt to the LLM 📝, giving it an information source to base the answer on. Just like reading research notes from a database and integrating them into your understanding before writing on a topic.\n\n3. **Generation**: Finally, the LLM leverages the augmented context to expand its knowledge and language capabilities to generate a response. Making the text produced not just fluent, but also accurate and factual, since it's based on relevant reference material.\n\nIn essence, RAG reduces the LLM's chance of hallucinating because now it gets to consult a knowledge base before responding. This makes responses more reliable and trustworthy, especially for topics requiring specific up-to-date facts.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img src=\"https://python.langchain.com/assets/images/vector_stores-125d1675d58cfb46ce9054c9019fea72.jpg\" height=800 width=800/>\n\n⭐ Photo credits: [Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### **Retrieval**\n\nTo use RAG, we need to have a database of documents that can provide relevant information for our queries. In this tutorial, we will create a database from the book \"How to Build a Career in AI\" by Andrew NG. We will use Langchain, Chroma, and Hugging Face to perform RAG on this book.\n\nThe process of creating a database involves the following steps:\n\n- **Chunking**: We divide the book into smaller pieces, such as paragraphs or sentences, that can be easily indexed and retrieved.\n\n- **Embedding**: We use a pre-trained model from Hugging Face to convert each chunk into a vector representation, also known as a sentence embedding. This captures the semantic meaning of the chunk and allows us to compare it with other chunks or queries.\n\n💡: For more information on vector embeddings check out the word embeddings section in my last lesson at [Notebook Link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/nathanyoung1/transformer-based-language-translation-in-pytorch). The word embeddings are combined to form sentence embeddings which we will refer to as vector embeddings throughout this tutorial.\n\n- **Indexing**: We store the vector embeddings in a vector database, such as Chroma, that can efficiently perform similarity search. This means that given a query vector, we can find the most similar vectors in the database, and retrieve the corresponding chunks.\n\nWhen we want to use RAG to generate a response for a query, we first embed the query using the same model as before. Then, as shown in the image above 👆 we use the vector database to find the most similar embeddings to the query embedding. These similar embeddings are linked to particular chunks of our document. We then fed this chunks as context to the LLM, enabling it to generate a coherent and informative answer.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# install the vector database, langchain, pypdf,
